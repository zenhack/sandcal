# 0.3

* Allow specifying intervals for repeat rules, e.g. "every 2 weeks"
  instead of just "every week." We could already display these correctly
  if they were imported via an .ics, but there was no UI for adding
  them.
* Allow adding multiple repeat rules for an event.
* Fixed a spelling error in some of the UI text.

# 0.2

* The new event form is now responsive for mobile devices.
* Fixed a bug where the upcoming events page would sometimes display
  the wrong date for events (<https://github.com/zenhack/sandcal/issues/19>)

# 0.1

* It is now possible to share a calendar in read-only mode.
* You can now export to an .ics file
* The user's time zone is now auto-detected; the corresponding settings
  dialog has been removed.
* The upcoming events page now adds (today) or (tomorrow) annotations
  where relevant.

# alpha-1

First release.
